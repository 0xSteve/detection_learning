# Learning Automata (LA) solutions to the link detection problem in Underwater surveillance networks (USNs)

The current working solution can be found in branch S-model.


#


# Running the simulations.

To run a simulation, in the desired simulation folder, open a terminal and type:

python3 simulation.py

or,for visualizations of algorithms type:

python3 visualize.py


# Installation of Dependencies.
All code is written and tested using Python 3.6.x, and requires the following dependencies:
- PIP 3
- scipy for Python 3.6.x (optional)
- numpy for Python 3.6.x 

Installation procedures follow for Debian-like GNU/Linux distributions.

## To install Python 3.6.x run the following command in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install python3

To verify that Python 3.6.x is installed, in the terminal type:

python3 --version

## To install PIP3 run the following command in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

## To install scipy run the following command in the terminal:

sudo pip3 install scipy

## To install numpy run the following command in the terminal:

sudo pip3 install numpy
