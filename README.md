# Learning Automata (LA) solutions to the link detection problem in Underwater surveillance networks (USNs)

The current practical solution model can be found in S-model. It is the research in the S-model folder that is associated with Learning to Communicated. A work submitted to the ACM WUWNET 2017 conference.

# P-model
The earliest stages of this work utilizing a binary environmental response, corresponding to a discrete-finite number of possible actions corresponding to operating depth. An impractial solution, which becomes intractable in memory as precision increases.

The work in P-model paved a path for a practical continuous control model used in S-model

#S-model
This directory contains the current research in link-state detection learning in limited mobility applied to underwataer acoustic sensor networks.

# Installation of Dependencies.
All code is written and tested using Python 3.6.x, and requires the following dependencies:
- PIP 3
- scipy for Python 3.6.x (optional)
- numpy for Python 3.6.x 

Installation procedures follow for Debian-like GNU/Linux distributions.

## To install Python 3.6.x run the following command in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install python3

To verify that Python 3.6.x is installed, in the terminal type:

python3 --version

## To install PIP3 run the following command in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

## To install scipy run the following command in the terminal:

sudo pip3 install scipy
