# Learning Automata (LA) solutions to the detection problem in Underwater surveillance networks (USNs)

# one_sensor_stationary_dlri - Discretized Linear Reward-Inaction (DLRI)

This folder contains a solution using a discretized linear reward-inaction automata. It is not as accurate as the linear reward-inaction, however it converges faster than any other model in this project.  This particular learning automata solution not likely to be useful for the detection learning problem.

# one_sensor_stationary_lri - Linear Reward-Inaction (LRI)

This folder contains the solution that is most likely to be useful for the applications of detection learning in USNs
